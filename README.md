# Project Overview

  This project involves building a custom parser for a subset of the Python programming language using ANTLR4. The parser supports basic arithmetic operations, compound assignment operations, and array definitions. It ensures syntactical correctness for these   expressions and assignments, while enforcing restrictions on improper operations (e.g., boolean + number or string + boolean).
